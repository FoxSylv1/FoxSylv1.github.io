    <h3>
        Goals
    </h3>
    <div class="project-data box">
        <p>
            My primary objective in creating this website was actually less as a
            place to put stuff (although that seems to be the end goal of what
            I created), and more like a testing ground to learn the basics of web
            development. My original intention was to focus on familiarizing
            myself with just HTML and CSS, for instance.

            <br><br>

            The catalyst to actually
            get me started was that a lot of people I knew already had
            decent-looking websites, so the self-imposed peer pressure slowly set
            off alarm bells that I was missing out on something. In hindsight,
            that's probably not the greatest reason, but in a sense, I was missing
            out, since I had been fully ignoring UI and non-tech-people's usability
            in general, to the point that it had been causing issues. With
            this website, I don't need to worry about that aspect as much, since I
            have some (read: a very small amount of) experience and a place to put
            what I make besides obscure Github repositories with the only
            instructions being "good luck."

            To be honest, an astonishing amount of my design process was just
            mashing random things together until I thought it looked acceptable.
            The few things I was careful to ensure stayed consistent was the
            orange color on a dark background (now present with the orange
            headers and beige text on a dark grey background) and an emphasis of
            contrast. This is why I have the orange name on a blue header and,
            perhaps more subtlely, both a serif and sans-serif font for headers
            and normal text, respectively. Other than that, I just eye-balled it.

            For hosting, I decided to use Github Pages, solely determined by the
            fact that the hosting was free, and free is good. It also introduced
            me to Jekyll and SCSS, which made the coding significantly easier
            and helped me follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle when
            creating this multi-page site. There were a few hiccups as I figured
            out how everything worked together, but I think I have a decent grasp
            on it, or at least a decent enough grasp to make this thing work.

    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <div class="project-data box">
        <p>
            I learned quite a bit from this excursion, but I still don't feel
            fully proficient. Probably the best comparison I can think of is that
            it feels like I'm congratulating myself for making my first calculator
            program on KhanAcademy, while the third year college student that
            specializes in Systems stands behind me with a baseball bat and says
            "mhm yep good job! :)".

            <br><br>

            My next steps are to try and get a handle more on javascript and start
            working towards learning React (which hopefully won't be too bad,
            although I definitely just jinxed it). Keep an eye out for any
            changes here, because I <em>am</em> still learning how all this stuff
            works, and hopefully there will be new projects to toy around with
            soon, assuming I don't get too sidetracked. For now, though, I think
            the current state of this website is good enough for now.
