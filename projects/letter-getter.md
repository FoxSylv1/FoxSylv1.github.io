            A daily grid-based anagram game

    <h3>
        Goals
    </h3>
    <div class="project-data box">
        <p>
            My primary objective was to enhance my familiarity with javascript
            and React. I decided on making this game specfiically by
            mashing together two word games that I enjoy: Bookworm Adventures,
            and Wordle. Thus the result is a grid-based anagram game similar to
            Bookworm Adventures, but also with the daily aspect of Wordle.
            <br /><br />
            Whether or not I did a good job in making an entertaining game, I
            don't really know. At the very least, I've recieved generally
            positive feedback (including from people who are not my mom,
            surprisingly), so I'll assume it's fine.

    <h3>
        Production Details
    </h3>

            The project is, effectively, just a mashup of React components with
            some scss styling thrown in for flair to make everything look nice.
            Along the way, however, there were a few fun surprises that I had
            to learn. Notably, local storage for storing the daily submission
            list across page reloads, for example.
            <br /><br />
            I was originally planning on having the daily and practice modes
            be located in separate pages, but then I looked at how that
            would work in React with routing. I got confused, and decided
            against that approach. Learning this aspect of development,
            though, is my goal for next project! (unless it doesn't fit in
            well, in which case I'll put it off further).

    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <div class="project-data box">
        <p>
            I think that, as of this point, I know how to make single page
            apps quite well. I have the core fundamentals down (HTML, CSS,
            JS) and know enough about React that I could make things work.
            Granted, there's no guarantee that it would work <i>well</i>,
            but it would work.
            <br /><br />
            I'm not sure how much I will continue this project, since it
            seems pretty finished to me. Unless I would like to do something
            crazy later with it, I may just move on to new things, and see
            what I can learn.
